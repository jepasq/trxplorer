- [X] Calling this in src is good ? no, in a new one
  npm init react-app src. No, it creates a second src directory
- [X] Initialize git repo
- [X] React app works, now add tronweb dependency
  https://github.com/tronprotocol/tronweb
- [X] We have an issue with tronweb
  Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'querystring' in '.../tronweb/dist'
- [X] NetworkStatus component may use property as in this example
  https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp
- [X] Network Status connected should hold all 3 values
  (fullNode/solidityNode/eventServer)
- [X] Should show program version
- [X] Connection status may become a complete react component
  with 'false' in red and maybe a description text on hover
  - [X] Added but the printed value is null (not updated)
- [X] The ConnectionStatus label is not printed. Fixed key was called label
- [X] May add a Network status React component
  Some stats from the main node ?
  using widget as class name
  And unit test (actually 2 tests)
  - [X] We now have the tronweb object, see
    https://developers.tron.network/reference/tronweb-object
  - [X] Maybe try with isConnected https://developers.tron.network/reference/isconnected
    Actuallt trying but the promise is waiting
